RaspberryPi BASIC
====

RaspberryPi BASIC is an homage to the Commodore 64; a bare-metal operating system that boots directly to a BASIC prompt, similar to early computers. Right now it's incredibly barebones, so expect bugs! The interpreter is based on Adam Dunkels' uBASIC, and the kernel is written in C++.

It builds upon awesome work by Josh Cole, Alex Chadwick, John Cronin and others.
